      "The place just look good in the photos but in real dnt ask 1 hour also I couldn't seat and the rate are like a 5 star hotel it would be more better if I would go to Marriott just next to it .this guys charge water bottle for 60 and service charge of 200 for 1200 bill worst experience .west of time and money",
      "#Not Recommend at all..!!üëé\nWorst service ever seen. the moment when we sat on sofa we found it full of dust. The captain/waiter dint even know about the menu's they have. After lot of confusion we ordered food and just for 1 starter and 2 main they took 40 mins. The taste was not at all great but rates are just high. Their main aim is just getting big money.\nBelieve me taste of punjab is just a name of the hotel, however there is nothing special as like that. Never visit and spoil ua time , mood & money.",
      "Hunger pangs.. late lunch.. we enter this place.\nBeginning with staff.. Very welcoming..gave a nice place to sit down.. ambience is very nice.. feel of dhaba in a restaurant ..\nMoving on to food we ordered lassi special which was very nice creamy .. all time favorite masala papad.. vade n chicken malwan curry which both were very well made . Then naan n veg curry.. unfortunately I don't remember the name of the dish..but it had kofta type of in the gravy.. again the taste of both very good... We did enjoy the food but the whole experience of tasting the food came after a long time of waiting for food.. this was our biggest disappointment.. that is the only reason I don't give a 4 rating...read more",
      "Liked the ambiance. Waiter suggested paneer chilly in starter which was good in taste. But paneer Tikka masala we ordered was ok. And yes enjoyed 50% off on food bill. Staff was very friendly and cooperative."

      "We went for birthday party of office colleague around 2pm after calling and checking with them at 1.30 pm. But to our surprise nothing was prepared and ready with them. After an hour we recieved only garlic bread and spring roll, though we were promised to get by 2.30pm. Even regular item like dal fry was getting prepared at 3pm and we can hear the whistle of cooker. Adding salt to this when we said we are leaving as it's an hour , they said ok and gave bill, so we doubt were they really preparing food in mean time. Adding masala to our experience, manager/owner went to take diesel for generator when electricity went off, so we had to sit in dark for around 15-20 mins. 1 star for effort...read more"
